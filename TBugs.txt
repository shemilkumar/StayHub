@) When sending data via post to /booking, req.body showing empty object {}

A) I have used multipart/form-data in calling post API in profile page, So when I use post call in   everywhere it is asigned multipart/form-data in Content-Type instead of application/json. If  application/json is not there, the req.body will not read data so it will show empty object.

// code:

     if (token){
       config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
       config.headers["Content-Type"] = 'multipart/form-data';
     }
